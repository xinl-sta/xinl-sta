Hi, 这里是 XiNL Dev STA！

你应该能注意到（能吧？），此账号的前身是 MacWinLin Studio STA，自 2023 年 12 月 9 日，MacWinLin Studio 正式解散，GitHub 组织已标记为归档。解散的原因是 MacWinLin Studio 已经没有任何 commit 长达一年半了。同时，之前的项目都太过简陋，因此，MacWinLin Studio 与 XN Team （在原本设想中所有 MacWinLin Studio 的管理层人员都是 XN Team 的成员）正式解散。

XiNL 融合了 Xinxin 和 MacWinLin Studio 的名称。XiN 指 Xinxin，NL 比较难解释，L 代表原名称的 Linux。

XiNL Dev Studio 简称 XiNL、XiNL Dev 或 XiNL Studio。

话虽这么说，但 XiNL Dev Studio 仍然在近期不会有任何计划。这主要是因为学业问题，敬请见谅。

什么是 STA？STA 是 **St**udio **A**ccount 的简称，意为工作室账号，为了保持 username 的简洁，故使用此简称。（我相信你不会喜欢 xinl-studio-account 这样的 username）

Hi, I am XiNL Dev STA!

You seem to have noticed (right?), this account was previously MacWinLin Studio STA. As of December 9, 2023, MacWinLin Studio has officially dissolved, and the GitHub organization has been marked as archived. The reason for the dissolution is that MacWinLin Studio has had no commits for the past year and a half. At the same time, the previous projects were too basic, so MacWinLin Studio and XN Team (as originally envisioned, all management members of MacWinLin Studio were members of XN Team) have officially dissolved.

XiNL is a fusion of the names Xinxin and MacWinLin Studio. XiN represents Xinxin, NL is a bit hard to explain, and L represents Linux from the original name.

The abbreviation for XiNL Dev Studio is XiNL, XiNL Dev, or XiNL Studio.

Although that's the case, XiNL Dev Studio won't have any plans in the near future. This is mainly due to academic reasons, and I hope for your understanding.

What is STA? STA stands for **St**udio **A**ccount. To keep the username concise, this abbreviation is used. (I believe you wouldn't like a username like xinl-studio-account.)
